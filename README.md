# My Blog Project

Welcome to the "My Blog" project! This project is a simple blogging platform created using Python Flask, Jinja2 templating engine, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to view a list of blog posts on the home page and read individual posts on separate pages.

- **Individual Post Pages**: Clicking on a post title takes the user to a dedicated page for that post, where they can read the full content.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Utilizes Flask's routing capabilities to handle different URLs for each post.
- **Template Rendering**: Uses Jinja2 templating to dynamically render HTML content with Python logic.
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented using HTML and CSS to ensure the website is visually appealing and functional across various devices.
